Domain Classifier — Layer C.

Classifies WHAT the user is talking about (knowledge space).
Uses embedding similarity against canonical domain descriptions.

This is the Tier 1 approach: semantic cluster matching.
Not keywords. Not regex. Embedding similarity against rich descriptions.

Completely independent from Action and Risk classification.
